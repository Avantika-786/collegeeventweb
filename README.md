# College Events
<pre>
Introduction : 
    In college, various clubs organize events throughout the year. Typically, information about 
    these events is shared via WhatsApp groups.It would be helpful to have a website where all
    the events and related information could be stored. This would make it easier for students
    to find relevant information about ongoing, past, or upcoming events. Such a website would
    benefit both students and college clubs.
